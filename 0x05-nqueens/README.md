## Overview

The “0x05. N queens” project is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, known for its application of the backtracking algorithm to place N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. To successfully complete this project, you will need to understand several key concepts and have access to resources that will help you grasp the necessary algorithms and techniques.

## Concepts Needed

### Backtracking Algorithms

- Understanding how backtracking algorithms work to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
- [Backtracking Introduction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/backtracking-introduction/)

### Recursion

- Using recursive functions to implement backtracking algorithms.
- [Recursion in Python](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/recursion)

### List Manipulations in Python

- Creating and manipulating lists, especially to store the positions of queens on the board.
- [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)

### Python Command Line Arguments

- Handling command-line arguments with the sys module.
- [Command Line Arguments in Python](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/system/python-sys-argv)

By studying these concepts and utilizing the resources provided, you will be equipped with the knowledge required to implement an efficient solution to the N queens problem using Python. This project not only tests programming and problem-solving skills but also offers an excellent opportunity to learn about algorithmic thinking and optimization techniques.
